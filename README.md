**Description**
I have automated the testing of the DailyFinance web application using Playwright JS. The test suite covers the following functionalities:

* User registration and validation of confirmation email & toast message
* Login and adding two random items to the list
* Profile photo upload and logout
* Password reset process and successful login validation

**Steps to run the project**
Install:
* Node.js
* Playwright
* Git
* Clone the repository
* Install dependencies
* Install playwright browsers

**Steps I have done**
* Implemented Playwright test cases to cover the registration, login, item addition, profile update, password reset, and re-login functionalities
* Added assertions to validate toast messages
* Configured .gitignore to exclude unnecessary files and folders (node_modules, .env, etc.)
* Generated test reports using **Allure
